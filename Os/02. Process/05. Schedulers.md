1. Long-term 
2. Short-term
3. Middle-term (only in time-sharing OS)

##### Long-term Scheduler
- When there are too many functions to be able to executed; they are stored in *disks*.
- So, *long-term* select process from disk and loads them to MM 
- May be invoked only when a process terminates(process leaves system)
- Less frequent
- It controls **degree of multi-programming**

##### Short term 
- Select  process from *ready* state and assign them CPU.
- More frequent than long-term.

> Most processes are either *I/O bound* or *CPU bound*.

##### Middle-term
- It removes a process from MM to reduce *level* of multi-pro and introduce it later.
- This process is called **swapping**.
