==A process can't access it's PCB, PCB is controlled by OS==

A *data structure* that contains all **data** need to restart a process, where it left off. 
![[Pasted image 20251005111339.png]]
It contains following:
1. `PID`
2. **Process State**: current state of process (such as ready, waiting, running ...)
3. **Program Counter**: Contains address of next instruction
4. *CPU*-scheduling info
5. *Memory* management info (also contains list of open files)
6. CPU registers
7. I/O status info
8. Priority
9. Protection (memory limits)

###### CPU registers
- Hold data that the CPU is actively using for calculations and operations, providing much faster access than main memory
- It contains:
	1. Program Counter
	2. Accumulator
	3. Index register
	4. Stack pointer
	5. General purpose registers
	6. Condition-code info (flags etc.)


- **Accumulators:** Registers used for storing the results of arithmetic and logical operations.
- **Index Registers:** Used for addressing memory, often for array manipulation.
- **Stack Pointers:** Point to the top of the process's stack, which is used for function calls and local variables.    
- **General-purpose Registers:** Used for a variety of tasks, like temporary data storage.
- **Condition-code Information:** Special registers that store status flags (e.g., zero flag, carry flag) resulting from an operation.
