##### Creation
> When a parent create a child process, it may continue to work *concurrently* or waits for termination of child process.

> Child process may use resource of parent or may create it's own.

##### Termination
- Done when process completes or by external factors.
- External factors include:
	- Parent process termination
	- User invoked termination

###### Child process terminates because of one of following:
1. The child exceeds resource allocated to it.
2. Child no longer needed.
3. Parent exit causing termination of child. 
>NOTE: some OS allow child to stay after termination of child.

**CASCADING TERMINATION**
Termination of *child* processes due to termination of *parent* process.

>[!note]
>After termination of child, it's removed form every where but it's **PID** remains in MM, it gets removed after *parent* calls `wait()`.

>**Zombie process** 
>When child process it terminated but parent haven't called `wait()`

>**Orphan**
>When parent is terminated and child is not.
