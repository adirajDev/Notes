#### Cache
1. Cache is used to make accessing data from main memory faster without increasing too much cost.

2. **Steps which are followed when CPU need to read data:**

3. Many cache system use **least-recently-used(LRU)** algorithm for *replacement* of old to add new.

#### I/O
Three ways to do:
1. Programmed
2. Interrupt-driven
3. Direct Memory Access(DMA)

##### 1. Programmed
- Processor has to *wait long time* for I/O operation.
- Degrade performance.

##### 2. Interrupt-driven
- Faster than programmed I/O
**Steps:**
1. Processor issues I/O module, then continue it's work
2. when I/O module is ready, it interrupts processor
3. Processor transfer data

##### 3. DMA
- CPU is involved only in beginning.
- Best method.
**Steps:**
1. CPU gives set of info to **DMA controller**, and then continues it's tasks
2. DMA controller does all the data transfer b/w *main memory and I/O*, word by word
3. After completion DMA sends an interrupt to CPU to inform it's done.
